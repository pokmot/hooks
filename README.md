# Wordpress Hooks Reworked

This code contains improvmenets on the Wordpress hooks system as it was
a couple of years ago.

It works in a very, very similar way to the original Wordpress code, but
has no dependencies at all.

I have done some refactoring of the code before publishing it on GitHub;
I have used this code in production for several years but I am keeping
the revision to 0.x until I have fully tested the refactoring.

The function calls will not change between 0.x and 1.x versions.

SemVer will be followed from v 1.x onwards.

## What's left to do?

- Unit Tests
- Better examples
- Better documentation (this file)

## Licensing

I am guessing this should be under the GPLv2 license as the code
is derived from the Wordpress Hooks system which is GPLv2.

How that affects your code I leave as an exercise to the reader; any
feedback is appreciated.
